# Food-Delivery-App
I have Created a Food-delivery-app using React-Native &amp; Redux &amp; Expo.
Developed and launched a React Native food delivery app from concept to production, collaborating closely with stakeholders to define requirements, design UI/UX interfaces, and implement key features.
Integrated third-party APIs for geolocation services, allowing users to discover nearby restaurants and track their delivery orders in real-time.
Implemented secure payment processing using Stripe or other payment gateway APIs, ensuring seamless transactions and data encryption for user privacy.
Enhanced app performance and user engagement through continuous iteration and optimization, incorporating user feedback and analytics insights to drive feature enhancements and improvements.
Worked collaboratively with cross-functional teams including designers, product managers, and QA testers to deliver high-quality software solutions on time and within budget constraints.
